## Instructions
Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly spray a 9x13" pan with non-stick cooking spray.

In a medium bowl combine flour, baking powder, and salt.

Separate the egg whites and yolks. Set egg whites off to the side

Add 3/4 c sugar to egg yolks and mix on high speed until yolks are pale. Add 1/3 cup milk and vanilla and stir to combine.

Pour the egg yolk mixture over the flour mixture and stir gently just until combined (don't over-mix)

Use electric egg beaters to beat the egg whites on high speed. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar as you mix and contiue beating until stiff peaks.

Fold the egg whites into the batter gently, just until combined. Pour batter into prepared pan. Make sure to smooth it into an even layer so your baked cake doesn't have divots in it.

bake 25-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove cake from the oven and allow cake to cool completely.

Combine evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and whole milk in a small bowl. Once
the cake has cooled, use a fork to poke holes all over the top of the cake.

Slowly pour the milk mixture over the the top of the cake, making sure to pour near the edges and all around.

Refridgerate the cake for at least 1 hour or overnight, to allow it to soak up the milk.

In the meantime, whip the heavy cream, sugar and vanilla until stiff peaks. Smooth over the top of the cake. Sprinkle cinnamon on top. Serve with fresh sliced strawberries, if desired. Enjoy!
