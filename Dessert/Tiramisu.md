## Instructions

Combine egg yolks and sugar in the top of a double boiler,
over boiling water. Reduce heat to low, and cook for about 10
minutes, stirring constantly. This is your sabayon, remove
from the heat and whip yolks until thick and lemon-colored.
Allow to cool briefly before mixing in mascarpone.

Add Mascarpone to whipped yolks, beat until combined.

In a separate bowl, using an electric mixer whip cream to stiff
peaks. (hand mixer or stand mixer is fine)

Gently fold the whipped cream in the mascarpone sabayon
mixture and set aside. The mascarpone does not have to be at
room temperature, but it will help it mix in easier if it is. Take
it out of the refrigerator as you gather ingredients to make the
recipe.

Mix the cold espresso with the coffee liquor and dip the
ladyfingers into the mixture just long enough to get them wet,
do not soak them!

Arrange the ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9-inch square
baking dish (or container similarly sized)

Spoon half the mascarpone cream filling over the ladyfingers.

Repeat process with another layer of ladyfingers

Add another layer of tiramisu cream

Refrigerate at least 4 hours. Overnight is best.

Dust with cocoa before serving


## Recipe Notes
If you can't find Mascarpone in your stores. You can make
this substitute. It won't be exactly the same but it will come
close.

8 ounces full fat cream cheese, 1/4 cup whipping cream and 2
tablespoons softened unsalted butter, whip until it's just blended.
This will give the equivalent of around 1 1/4 cups mascarpone.

Have the eggs and mascarpone at room temperature before
making this recipe. That will help them mix together more
smoothly

Whipping your cream is also where some people make a
mistake. The idea with whipped cream is to do it slowly. Begin
whipping the cream on low, increasing the speed over 10
minutes. This makes a whipped cream that will last for days in
your fridge without the aid of gelatin.
Soak the ladyfingers in the coffee mixture briefly. Don't let them
get soggy, it will ruin the dessert.

only use Crunchy SAVOIARDI (ITALIAN LADYFINGERS) Cake
style ladyfingers will get too soft.

Allow Tiramisu to set up for at least 6 hours before serving.
Overnite is best.
