## Instructions

Place all ingredients in a blender or food processor and pulse until just chunky

Taste and adjust seasonings if needed. Refrigerate at least an hour to let the flavors meld. 

The salsa may be lighter red
than store-bought salsa due to the air blended in and fresh tomatoes are usually lighter in color than canned. It may darken up as the air settles.
