## Instructions

simmer. Oncc simmering, ruduce the heat to low.

Place egg yolks and 1 teaspoon water in a medium mixing bowl and
whisk until mixture lightens in color, approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Add
the sugar and whisk for another 30 seconds.

Place the mixture over the simmering water and whisk constantly for 3
to 5 minutes, or until there is a clear line that is drawn in the mixture
when you pull your whisk through, or the mixture coats the back of a spoon.

piece at a time, and whisk until all of the butter is incorporated. Place
the bowl back over the simmering water occasionalty so that it will be warm
enough the melt the butter. Add the salt. lemon juice. and cayenne pepper.
