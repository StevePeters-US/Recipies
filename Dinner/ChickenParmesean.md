## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 450°F (230°C).
2. Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic or resealable freezer bags, pounding them firmly with a meat mallet until they reach ½ inch thickness.
3. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper.
4. Sprinkle flour evenly over both sides of the chicken breasts using a sifter or strainer.
5. Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.
6. Mix bread crumbs and ½ cup Parmesan cheese, setting them aside as well.
7. Dip each flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs and then transfer it to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides.
8. Let the coated chicken breasts rest for 10-15 minutes after coating.
9. Heat 1/2 inch of olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until shimmering.
10. Cook each chicken breast in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side.
11. Transfer cooked chicken to a baking dish and top each breast with:
    * 2 tablespoons tomato sauce
    * Mozzarella cheese
    * Fresh basil
    * Provolone cheese
12. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each breast with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.
13. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly, and chicken breasts are no longer pink (15-20 minutes).
