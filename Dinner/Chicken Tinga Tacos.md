## Instructions

Chicken: Place the tomatoes, tomatillos, onions, garlic, and jalapefios on a non-stick cookie
sheet tray and toss in 3 tablespoons of olive oil, salt and pepper, and roast in the oven at 425F for 30 to 35 minutes or until everything is lightly charred.

Next, add all roasted ingredients into a blender along with chipotle pepper, ground cumin,
dry oregano, salt, and pepper to a blender and puree until smooth.

Season the chicken on all sides with salt and pepper and in a large rondeau pot over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of olive oil sear the chicken until golden brown on both sides,
about 8-10 minutes per side.

Add the tomatillo mixture along with the chicken stock, stir and cover and simmer over low
heat for 2 hours.

Remove the skin and bones from the chicken and shred. Keep warm.

To Plate: Place some shredded chicken in a heated corn tortilla and garnish with avocado, red onion, cilantro, and Oaxaca cheese.

## Chef Notes:
Make-Ahead: You can make this recipe up to 1 day ahead of time, just simply reheat before
serving.
How to Reheat: Add the desired amount to a medium size saucepot with a lid and cook over
low heat until hot. You can also heat in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until hot.
How to Store: Cover and refrigerate for up to 5 days. This will freeze very well covered for up to
3 months. Thaw for 1 day in the refrigerator before reheating.
You can absolutely use whatever tomatoes you'd like in this recipe. In the summer all different
types are fair game and if making in the winter, stick to Roma or cherry tomatoes.
To make this in a slow cooker, simply use the sauté function to brown the chicken and then add
the sauce and then slow cook on high for 6 hours.
