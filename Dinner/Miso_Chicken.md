## Instructions
1. In a large bowl, whisk together rice vinegar, miso paste, honey, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, and garlic.
Add chicken breasts to bowl and coat with the sauce. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a baking dish with nonstick cooking spray and transfer chicken to the
dish, reserving marinade. Bake chicken for 15 minutes. Baste the chicken with pan juices and bake
another IO minutes. Tum on broiler and broil chicken for 3 to 5 minutes until golden brown on top.
3. While chicken is baking, transfer marinade to a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and
simmer until reduced by half and sauce is syrupy, about 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Serve chicken with chopped scallions and miso-glaze drizzled on top.
