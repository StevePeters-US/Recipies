## Instructions

In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.

Stir incrushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian
seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours,
stirring occasionally.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 1O minutes.
Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. 

In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining
parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups Of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third Of
mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup
Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with
foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the
cheese.

Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15
minutes before serving.
