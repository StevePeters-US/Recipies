## Instructions
In a saucepan, warm the broth over low heat.

Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the mushrooms, and
cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid, and set aside.

Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to skillet, and stirin the shallots. Cook 1 minute. Add rice, stirring to coat with
oil, about 2 minutes. When the rice has taken on a pale, golden color, pour in wine, stirring constantly
until the wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed.
Continue adding broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring continuously, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is
al dente, about 15 to 20 minutes

Remove from heat, and stir in mushrooms with their liquid, butter, chives, and parmesan. Season with
salt and pepper to taste.
