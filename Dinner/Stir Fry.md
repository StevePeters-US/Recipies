## Instructions
Use 3 tbsp Stir Fry Sauce + 6 tbsp water to make a stir fry for 2 people
using around 5 cups of uncooked ingredients (proteins + vegetables).

1. Heat 2 tbsp oil in wok over high heat.
2. Add your choice of Base Flavourings - fry for 10 seconds or so to infuse oil.
3. Add stir fry ingredients in order of time to cook (starting with ingredients that take
longest to cook), leaving leafy greens, like the leaves of bok choy, until when you
add the sauce (otherwise they will wilt and overcook).
4. Add noodles (if using), sauce and water, your choice of Additional Flavourings and
any leafy greens.
5. Gently toss to combine and to let the sauce cook for around 1 minute. The sauce will
become a thick, glossy sauce that coats your stir fry.
6. Serve immediately.

## Notes
1. Light soy sauce is lighter in colour that the more common dark soy sauce, but it is
actually saltier. The main reason for using light soy sauce in this recipe is so the colour is
not as dark. So if you do not have light soy sauce, you can substitute it with normal soy
sauce, but the sauce will be darker than it should be, and slightly less salty (but not very
noticeable).
I use Lee Kum Kee brand for the light soy sauce and Kikkoman for the ordinary soy
sauce. If you don't have all purpose soy sauce, just use more light soy sauce, and same
if you don't have light soy sauce i.e. just use more all purpose.
2. If using dried rather than fresh noodles, add a few extra tablespoons of water. The
reason for this is that dried noodles, even after cooking them (usually just by covering
them in hot water in a bowl), absorb more liquids than fresh noodles. So you need more
liquid to have a saucier finish.
3. To make this sauce vegan, substitute the oyster sauce with hoisin sauce. This gives
the sauce a slight Chinese Five Spice Powder flavour which is thoroughly authentic!
4. This will last for weeks and weeks, depending on the expiry date of the ingredients
you use. There is nothing in this that will go "off", so just check the expiry date of the
ingredients you use in this, at use that as a guide. I usually use mine in about 4 weeks,
but it will definitely last longer.
If you have it in the fridge for ages untouched, then you will need a butter knife or
something to mix up the cornstarch that will settle and harden in the bottom of the jar.
5. Chinese Cooking Wine (Shaosing / Shaoxing wine) - this plays an important part in
giving this sauce depth of flavour so it tastes like the sauce you get at Chinese
restaurants. Without it, the sauce will lack "something". It's a cooking wine sold at
supermarkets in Australia in the Asian section but much cheaper at Asian stores -
It has a very long shelf life - years and years (and it's used in 99%
are the bottles I use.
of the Chinese recipes on my site).
Best substitute is dry sherry, followed by Mirin or Japanese cooking sake. If you use
Mirin, leave out the sugar in the recipe.
However, for those who cannot have alcohol, apple juice or grape juice is the best
substitute. Otherwise, chicken broth/stock, as a second fall back, with 2 teaspoons of
white wine vinegar + 1/2 tsp sugar.
IMPORTANT: If you use a sub, then the shelf life of the sauce will be determined by the
shelf life of what you use as the sub.
6. These quantities make stir fries that are nicely coated with sauce, but without ppols of
sauce. The stir fry is saucier than the noodles, so it soaks into the rice. With the noodles,
the sauce clings to it really well so you don't need pools of sauce. If you want more sauce, increase the amount of Stir Fry Sauce used with double the amount of water e.g.
If you add 1 tbsp Stir Fry Sauce, add 2 tbsp water.
