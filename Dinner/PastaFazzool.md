## Instructions

1) Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Brown sausage while breaking it into
small pieces, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add diced celery and
chopped onion. Cook until onions are translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add dry pasta.
Cook and stir 2 minutes.

2) Stir in tomato paste until evenly distributed, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 3 cups broth.
Raise heat to high and bring to a simmer. Add salt, black pepper, pepper flakes,
and oregano. When soup comes to a boil, reduce heat to medium and let it simmer
about 5 minutes, stirring often. Check soup consistency and add more broth, if
needed.

3) Place chopped chard in a bowl. Cover with cold water and rinse the leaves; any grit
will fall to the bottom of the bowl. Transfer chard to colander to drain briefly; add
to soup. Cook anci stir until leaves wilt, 2 to 3 minutes.

4) Stir in white beans; continue cooking and stirring until pasta is perfectly cooked,
another 4 or 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in grated cheese. Serve topped
with grated cheese, if desired.
