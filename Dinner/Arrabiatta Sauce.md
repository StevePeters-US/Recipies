# Arrabiatta Sauce

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Olive Oil | 4 tablespoons |
| Garlic | 8-10 cloves, minced |
| Crushed Red Pepper Flakes | 1 teaspoon - 5 teaspoons (adjust to taste) |
| Yellow Onion | 1 cup, finely chopped |
| Crushed Tomatoes (San Marzano if possible) | 1 can (28 oz), crushed tomatoes only |
| Whole Tomatoes (San Marzano if possible) | 1 can (28 oz), whole tomatoes only|
| Tomato Paste | 2 tablespoons |
| Fish Sauce | 2 teaspoons |
| Fresh Basil Leaves | ½ cup, torn with hands |
                                                                           

## Instructions

1. In a large Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high and cook sliced onions (or minced onion) until they are translucent.
2. Add minced garlic and red pepper flakes; sauté for an additional minute, stirring occasionally so nothing burns but the flavor infuses in the oil.
3. Reduce heat to medium and add tomato products, fish sauce, salt, and stir until they are well combined.
4. Bring the mixture to a simmer before adding larger tomatoes; mash them gently with a spoon or utensil as it simmers.
5. Transfer the Dutch oven to a preheated 350°F (175°C) oven and cook for 90 minutes, stirring every 30 minutes to prevent scorching.
6. Remove from the oven and stir in basil around the last 15-20 minutes of cooking time. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired.

**Notes:**
5 tsp of red pepper is very hot
