## Instructions
Line large baking sheet with parchment or silicone liner. In a small dish, combine seasonings: 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp
cayenne pepper, 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper and evenly sprinkle seasoning mix over both sides of tilapia.

Lightly drizzle fish with olive oil and dot each piece with butter. Bake at 375 for 20-25 min. To brown edges, broil for 3-5
minutes at the end if desired.

Combine all Taco sauce ingredients in a medium bowl and whisk until well blended.

To serve the tacos, toast the corn tortillas on a large dry skillet or griddle over medium/high heat

To assemble: start with pieces of fish then add remaining ingredients finishing with a generous sprinkle of cotija cheese
and finally that awesome taco sauce! Serve with a fresh lime wedge to squeeze over tacos.
