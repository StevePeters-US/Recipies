## Instructions

Dissolve yeast in 1 cup warm water in a small bowl; let stand 5 minutes. Conbine 1 1/4 cups cold water, oil, sugar, and salt in a
bowl; stir with a whisk.

Weigh or lightly spoon 24.9 ounces (about 5 1/4 cups) flour into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine flour, yeast mixture, and
cold water mixture in bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Mix on low 8 minutes or until dough begins to form. Let rest 2 ninutes;
mix on low 6 minutes or until dough is smooth. Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 2 minutes); add
enough of the remaining 1.19 ounces (about 1/4 cup) flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands (dough will feel
sticky).

Divide the dough in half, and place each portion in a large zip-top bag coated with cooking spray. Seal and chill ovemight or up to 2 days.
Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before using.
Note: You can freeze the dough in heavy-duty, freezer-safe zip-top plastic bags for up to 2 months; thaw dough overnight in the refrigerator.
