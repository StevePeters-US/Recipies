## Instructions

First, preheat oven to 350ºF and line a muffin tin with muffin liners. We suggest also spraying your muffin liners with cooking spray just in case.
Next, place dry ingredients into a medium bowl and mix.
Then, in a large bowl crack 2 eggs and whisk. Add maple syrup, milk, and preferred pureed fruit* and mix again.
Add dry ingredients into wet ingredients and then mix. Then, add in melted coconut oil and mix again.
At this point, add any of the add-ins for one of the 6 muffin recipes in this post and mix again.
Fill each muffin about 3/4 of the way full (these are going to be big muffins). Then, place in the oven at 350ºF and bake for 18-22 minutes or until the center is fully cooked.
Let cool for 5 minutes and then remove from the muffin tin to continue cooling.
