## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, salt, and baking soda, and set aside.
2. Add the softened butter into a mixer's bowl. Add the granulated sugar and
brown sugar. Cream the butter and sugars on medium speed. Add the egg, and
vanilla extract, and mix until well combined. Slowly incorporate the flour
mixture until thoroughly combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.
3. Refrigerate dough for one hour or overnight.
4. Preheat the oven to 375F, and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
5. Scoop the chilled dough onto the baking sheets and transfer it to the center
shelf of the oven. Bake 8 to 10 minutes, until the tops are golden brown and
the cookies have solid edges (the centers will be soft). Remove from oven and
allow cookies to cool down completely.
6. Bake any remaining cookies, allow to cool down completely before storing in
an airtight container.
