## Instructions

For the Spiced Sugar

In a small bowl mix the granulated sugar and pumpkin pie spice together. Set aside.
¼ cup (50 g) granulated white sugar, ½ teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

For the Pumpkin Cookies

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. <br>
Start by drying your pumpkin. (This step is not optional. The cookies will not bake properly if you skip this step.)<br>
Spread the canned pumpkin on a plate and lightly press with a paper towel to absorb the excess liquid. Repeat the step at least four more times.<br>
The pumpkin should be dry enough that it goes from being ½ cup dried down to just about a ¼ cup. Hardly any liquid should transfer onto a paper towel once it has been dried enough.<br>
(Like stated above, try to use Libby's canned pumpkin as almost all cans of it have the same consistency and are not too wet.)
Then set aside.
½ cup (122 g) canned pumpkin puree
In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.<br>
1 ¾ cups (219 g) all purpose flour, spooned and leveled, 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice, ½ teaspoon baking soda, ½ teaspoon baking powder, ½ teaspoon salt<br>
In a large bowl cream the softened butter and brown sugar together with an electric mixer on high speed for 1-2 minutes until light and fluffy.<br>
¾ cup (168 g) unsalted butter, softened, 1 cup (220 g) light brown sugar, packed<br>
Add in the egg yolks and vanilla and mix on medium speed until pale and fluffy, about 1-2 minutes.<br>
2 egg yolks, at room temperature, 2 teaspoon vanilla<br>
Add in the pumpkin and mix on medium-low speed to combine.<br>
Add in the dry ingredients and mix on low speed just until combined.<br>
Scoop the dough with a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop, and roll them into balls. Then roll the dough balls in the spiced sugar.<br>
(If the dough is too "sticky" chill it in the fridge for 10 minutes, then proceed.)<br>
Place the cookie dough balls at least 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. (I usually bake 6 at a time.)<br>
Bake the cookies for 12-14 minutes. (12 minutes for really chewy centers, 14 minutes for a slightly crispier cookie). When the cookies are done baking the centers will be puffy. As hey cool the centers will fall and the cookie will get "wrinkly".<br>
Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack to finish cooling. They are best enjoyed when they have cooled for at least 15 minutes!
