## Instructions

Heat the butter in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Whisk in the brown sugar and maple syrup and cook for about 5 minutes or until all the sugar has melted and thickened slightly. <br>Add the pecans (if using) and mix to combine. Add the banana slices and cook for about a minute. Remove the pan from the heat and add the rum or rum extract.<br> Return the pan to the heat and cook for about 3-4 minutes. This will burn off the alcohol in the rum leaving you with just the flavor.<br>
To serve, place a couple slices of French toast on a plate and spoon the bananas and syrup over the French toast. Serve immediately with a dollop of whipped cream (optional)
